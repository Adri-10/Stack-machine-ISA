Design a stack machine, its instruction set must be stack oriented (no register!)
In computer science, computer engineering and programming language implementations, a stack machine is a computer processor or a virtual machine in which the primary interaction is moving short-lived temporary values to and from a push down stack.
In the case of a hardware processor, a hardware stack is used. The use of a stack significantly reduces the required number of processor registers.
Stack machines extend push-down automaton with additional load/store operations or multiple stacks and hence are Turing-complete.
